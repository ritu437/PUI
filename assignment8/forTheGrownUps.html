                        <p>In today’s media landscape consent is mainly discussed within a sexual context, however, at the root of it, consent is simply the act of giving permission. Teaching young children about general consent regarding their bodies can help keep them safe now by empowering them to be the boss of their own body. In the era of #metoo, we should all be striving to create a culture of consent in which mutual consent is a part of social life as well as the narrative around sex. Kids who grow up believing that they and others have the right to say what does and doesn’t happen to their bodies are better equipped to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate touch, ask for permission, respect no, and interfere in situations where consent is not present. Having a strong understanding of consent is something that will help serve them well in the playground, workplace, and beyond as they grow.</p>
